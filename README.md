# Mantenipro - Frontend

Mantenipro is a web application designed to digitize and optimize maintenance management, focusing on improving efficiency, communication, and task control while addressing common issues such as disorganization, lack of visibility, and unnecessary costs, specifically targeting critical equipment like air conditioning systems and solar panels.

## Features

- **React and Next.js:** Built using React with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- **Stripe Integration:** Implements Stripe for secure and seamless payment processing.
- **API Integration:** Utilizes the backend API of Mantenipro.
- **QR Code Generation:** Employs qrcode and qrcode.react to create QR codes dynamically.
- **Tailwind CSS:**  Provides rapid and consistent styling for a responsive UI.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your Linux console:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>


2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install


3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
    npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
